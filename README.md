Project Culminate
=========


As the title says,Project Culminate.
Currently an API structure for culminating news from different sources and curating them.
Done in python

Instead of de[ending upon  3rd party API service for news feeds, started scrapping RSS feeds my own for independent developing and better confidence on the process


To be done in future:
1) Have to include asynchio to increase performance
2) Have to train a model to weed out fake,corrupted,incomplete articles
